<h1>Task Description</h1>

Make PL/Perl6 (a part of <a href="http://pl.parrot.org">PL/Parrot</a>) work on the latest <a href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo">Rakudo Perl 6</a> release.

<h1>Steps To Complete This Task</h1>

Recently, a change in Rakudo Perl 6 and/or Parrot caused PL/Perl6 to start failing some tests. This task to
identify the problem and fix it. It is probably very little code that needs to change, but finding out what
the problem is will be challenging.

Currently, when you run the PL/Perl6 test suite on a Rakudo Star release, or the Rakudo master branch, 
the test suite goes into an infinite loop. More specifically, the PostgreSQL process that the test
suite spawns starts to take 100% CPU and is eventually killed by the postmaster process, which controls
all the child PostgreSQL processes.

This task will require identifying exactly which part of the code in

<a href="https://github.com/leto/plparrot/blob/master/plparrot.c">plparrot.c</a>

is causing the behaviour. Most likely, PL/Parrot is getting something from Rakudo which is invalid, and then
passes it along to PostgreSQL, which doesn't react well.

<li>Read the PL/Parrot <a href="https://github.com/leto/plparrot/blob/master/README">README</a>
<li>Perform all the necessary code and/or documentation changes</li>
<li>Build parrot and run it's test suite (make test_plperl6) to verify that things still work</li>
<li>Create a Github pull request (button on the upper right of your fork) to have your changes incorporated into the master repository</li>
</ol>

<h1>Benefits</h1> 
<ol>
<li>
This will allow PL/Perl6 to continue to be developed and allow people to write database stored procedures in Perl 6!
</li>
